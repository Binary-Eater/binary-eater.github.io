Why did I want to contribute changes to plasma-nm? If you have peaked at my GitHub profile or activity, you probably know a couple of things about me.
I do not use Plasma or GNOME but rather Xmonad. I mostly focus on kernel development and related low-level subjects these days. So why would I bother contributing to plasma-nm?</description></item><item><title>bcm4331 and MacBook WiFi woes</title><link>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/bcm4331_and_macbook_wifi_woes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 18:09:27 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/bcm4331_and_macbook_wifi_woes/</guid><description>Story Time DISCLAIMER: skip this section if you want to get to the core content.
Before running off thinking this has nothing to do with Linux kernel development, we will get there (I promise). However, I think some background context is in order. Rewind a year back to LPC 2022, I was attending LPC for the very first time (virtually). I was super excited since LPC is basically a treasure trove of talks that typically catch my interest.</description></item><item><title>bpftrace</title><link>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/bpftrace/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 21:32:59 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/bpftrace/</guid><description>What is bpftrace? bpftrace is both a CLI tool and a tracing language that compiles down to Linux enhanced Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) instructions. The BPF VM subsystem in the Linux kernel is immensely powerful. Covering it would require a separate article. For now, think of eBPF as some kind of mechanism that magically enables sandboxed loading of injected logic into priveleged contexts from userspace. bpftrace makes use of eBPF to inject dynamic tracing instruments.</description></item><item><title>kexec</title><link>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/kexec/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 21:32:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/kexec/</guid><description>What is kexec? kexec is short for kernel execute. At a high level, it is analogous with the syscall exec. kexec replaces the memory of the currently loaded kernel image and begins executing the newly loaded kernel image. tl;dr it enables users to run new kernels without needing to do a full power cycle of a system.
What is the value of kexec? Enables a &amp;#34;boot once&amp;#34; flow for testing a potentially problematic kernel.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://binary-eater.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 19:35:45 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://binary-eater.github.io/about/</guid><description>I am an open source enthusiast mainly interested in low-level programming and operating systems. My personal interests are mainly in PC-class development and improving the personal computing space in the open source community. On my free time, I mess around with input devices and the stacks related to them.
For fun, I have worked on the hid-nvidia-shield driver. I started this project after playing some games with a friend and learning that Xbox controllers had first class haptics support on Linux (thanks to the xpad driver made by individuals) while the NVIDIA SHIELD controller I was using did not.</description></item><item><title>Site theme change</title><link>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/theme_change/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 18:23:18 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/theme_change/</guid><description>Why I changed the theme of my site? When I first started this page, I built my own theme hugo-theme-ghci based on the work done on the hugo-theme-ghci theme. I did this because I dislike the idea of using someone else&amp;#39;s creative work to express myself on a personal site. I am really thankful to people who share themes for this purpose. I just thought back then I could make something more creative that expresses my interests.</description></item><item><title>The Tunnel to Summer, the Exit of Goodbyes</title><link>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/tunnel_to_summer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 12:44:22 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/tunnel_to_summer/</guid><description>Natsu e no Tonneru, Sayonara no Deguchi Original work written by

This includes both the software and physical sides. Normally, I do not think setups are worth discussing. However, I do think there is something to be gained in this specific case since I currently do not use normal or &amp;#34;out of the box&amp;#34; gear + software stack. Listed below are some of the highlights in my setup that will be expanded on in the near future.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://binary-eater.github.io/description/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://binary-eater.github.io/description/</guid><description>I am a programmer primarily focused on delving into kernel-space programming.
My secondary interests are programming languages and related concepts.
I enjoy doing work that generates truly &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; software.</description></item></channel></rss>
