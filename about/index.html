operating systems. My personal interests are mainly in PC-class development and
improving the personal computing space in the open source community. On my free
time, I mess around with input devices and the stacks related to them.</p><p>For fun, I have worked on the <a href=https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/hid/hid-nvidia-shield.c>hid-nvidia-shield</a> driver. I started this project
after playing some games with <a href=https://github.com/PiotrGalusza>a friend</a> and learning that Xbox controllers had
first class haptics support on Linux (thanks to the <code>xpad</code> driver made by
individuals) while the NVIDIA SHIELD controller I was using did not. We were
playing <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/263300/BlazBlue_Calamity_Trigger/>BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger</a> at the time, and it was lame to not have
haptics support in the game on my controller while the Xbox controller had a
nice experience.</p><p>For my work at NVIDIA, I do specialized work regarding <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol>IEEE 1588 PTP</a> and other
timestamping application support in the <a href=https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core>upstream mlx5 netdev driver</a> for <a href=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet-adapters/>NVIDIA's
Mellanox ConnectX NIC product line</a>. The mlx5 driver is a large driver due to
the various enterprise networking applications supported by our family of
devices. I work on a fairly small part of the driver, mainly components
involving PTP and recently MACsec these days. If you are interested in how to
write arbitrary userspace applications that can take advantage of various
timestamping information provided by the kernel and potentially your networking
hardware, I would take a look at the <a href=https://docs.kernel.org/networking/timestamping.html>related kernel documentation</a>. I was at
<a href=https://netdevconf.info/0x17/>NetDevConfx17 in Vancouver</a> on behalf of NVIDIA, and there was an <a href=https://netdevconf.info/0x17/sessions/talk/so_timestamping-powering-fleetwide-rpc-monitoring.html>interesting
talk by Willem de Brujin</a> (upstream kernel socket timestamping maintainer and
kernel developer at Google) on this subject as well.</p><p>I do enjoy peeking around the datacenter class open source development space,
since some of the work there can be re-used for personal computing. An example
is BPF and its original heavy use in the networking space. Now we see more
applications of BPF in the space of system profiling and debugging as well as
with <a href=https://docs.kernel.org/hid/hid-bpf.html>HID-BPF</a>.</p><p>I am fine with being addressed by my real name Rahul Rameshbabu or my online
profile handle Binary-Eater (you can shorten that to beater if you prefer when
typing in chat).</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
