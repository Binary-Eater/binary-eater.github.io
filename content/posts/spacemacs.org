* Plans for this page
Spacemacs is my editor all the time. I use it for text editing but also use it
for tasks beyond programming. Like a number of other things on this site, I was
introduced to [[https://develop.spacemacs.org/][spacemacs]] by [[https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/department-faculty/mattox][Professor Mattox A. Beckman]]. My plan is to write
about the features I use and delve into my ~.spacemacs~ a bit.
