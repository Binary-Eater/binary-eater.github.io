* Goal of this page
I really enjoy using [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]]. [[https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/department-faculty/mattox][Professor Mattox A. Beckman]] from UIUC got me into
using ~org~. Since then, I have been using ~org~ for driving just about
everything in my personal and professional life. Even the content of this site
is written using ~org mode~. The goal of this page is to share some of the
things I enjoy in ~org~ that others may enjoy.
