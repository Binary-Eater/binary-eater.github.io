Currently, the site uses [[https://github.com/Binary-Eater][hugo-theme-ghci]] for its functionality and style
choices. This page is used to present shortcomings that seem to arise from the
design and potentially solutions for addressing them.

* Enhancement ideas

+ Currently, inter-page navigation is non-existent
  - This is especially problematic considering that the homepage does not load
    immediately but animates
  - Traditional navigation mechanisms found in typical websites feel clunky to me
    * Would want to implement a context switcher similar to [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-command-palette][GitHub's]] or [[https://slack.engineering/a-faster-smarter-quick-switcher/][Slack's]]
      implementation
      + Implementing this in vanilla web programming for a ~hugo~ theme seems
        difficult
      + Probably better, if wanting to implement this, to venture into [[https://github.com/ajnsit/concur][Concur]]
        and [[https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs][GHCJS]]
+ "Skip animation" button for landing page
  - As cool as it is for me to see for the first time or after a break, the
    animations are exhausting when using the site with back to back reloads
+ Fancy 404 page

* Disclaimer
I am not a web developer nor do web applications fascinate me in any way, shape,
or form. I live in a world of text and solely use a keyboard with no mouse.
Given that, I assume my priorities for improving this site beyond fixing
breaking issues will be low.

If some of these enhancement ideas interest you/you would like to use
~hugo-theme-ghci~ for your own site, feel free to contribute ðŸ™‚.

Navigating this site is significantly more comfortable when using something like
[[https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl][Tridactyl]], [[https://qutebrowser.org/][qutebrowser]], or [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/][nyxt]].
