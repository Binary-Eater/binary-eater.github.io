* Plans for this page
I have started to self-teach myself Haskell. The experience has been
interesting. A lot of effort to really delve deep into the fpl and type theory
concepts. I took two programming language courses in my undergrad. One course
was taught in OCaml, while the other involved the [[https://kframework.org/][K framework]]. However, I still
found my learning journey to be a non-trivial but fun one. I unfortunately did
not get the opportunity to take the course under [[https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/department-faculty/mattox][Professor Mattox A. Beckman]] in
Haskell. The equivalent course taught in OCaml by [[https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/madhu][Professor Madhusudan
Parthasarathy]] was terrific. Just have to self-learn Haskell now ðŸ™‚. Anyways, the
goal here is write about my starting from zero experiences.
