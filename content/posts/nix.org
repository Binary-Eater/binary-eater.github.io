* Goal of this page
I think the way [[https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html][Nix]] approaches package management is brilliant. [[https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/developing-with-nix-shell.html][nix-shell]] is an
amazing tool for handling dependency specification of a project in a way that
supports diverging from the system libraries and components. I learned about
~NixOS~ from [[https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/department-faculty/mattox][Professor Mattox A. Beckman]].

I plan to write content about the things I like in ~nix~ and ~NixOS~.
