Normally, I do not think setups are worth discussing. However, I do think there
is something to be gained in this specific case since I currently do not use
normal or "out of the box" gear + software stack. Listed below are some of the
highlights in my setup that will be expanded on in the near future.</p><ul><li><p>NixOS</p><ul><li><p>btrfs</p><ul><li>LVM on LUKS</li><li>Encrypted <code>/boot</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>XMonad</li><li>Spacemacs</li><li>34" 21:9 3440x1440@60Hz LG FreeSync monitor</li><li>ErgoDox w/ Halo Trues</li><li><p>CODE modified w/ Aqua Zilents 67g and SA Oblivion</p><ul><li><p>Matching custom aviator cable from <a href=https://mechcables.com/>MechCables</a></p><ul><li>I think large or JUMBO coils are the way to go personally</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>xDuoo TA-10R tube headphone DAC/Amp</li><li><p>Drop + HIFIMAN HE5XX planar magnetic headphones</p><ul><li><p>Not an audiophile.

my work area, would be to use <a href=https://unity.com/>Unity</a> to create a virtual recreation (not exact. I
am not artsy in any way, shape, or form aside from maybe ascii art) of my work
environment that I would then export as <a href=https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html>WebGL that can be interacted with on the
site</a>. This would enable users with the ability to interact with the 3D rendering
in a way that then correlates with information about the component displayed on
the site. This experience would be quite immersive and, truthfully, fun to play
with.</p><p>However, doing this would require a lot of time and energy that I can put into
learning and contributing to kernel-space development. I also have a day job
that eats up quite a bit of time. I tend to like making contributions that
benefit more than just myself if possible (of course, I like to personally
benefit from such a contribution as well).</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-4>The middle-ground</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3><p>Add some nice SVGs of each component to show them off (not sure how hard this
