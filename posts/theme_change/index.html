the work done on the <a href=https://github.com/Yukuro/hugo-theme-shell>hugo-theme-ghci</a> theme. I did this because I dislike the
idea of using someone else's creative work to express myself on a personal site.
I am really thankful to people who share themes for this purpose. I just thought
back then I could make something more creative that expresses my interests.
Unfortunately, reality has a nice way of crashing into you like freight train.
The work it would take for me to build a creative site on top of upstream
development work I am interested is too much for me right now. In terms of
programming, I want to make my C and Rust as strong as possible as well as my
knowledge of computer architecture and algorithms.</p><p>Focusing on improving this website would distract me with the JavaScript webdev
world (which itself is vast and important). That said, I have seen some flows
involving <a href=https://elmprogramming.com/>Elm</a> and SPA development that would interest me for this site. tl;dr I
do not want to write any JavaScript or its derivatives (e.g. TypeScript) if I
can help it.</p><p>I am currently using the <a href=https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c>m10c</a> hugo theme for this site but may change things up
a bit if I ever get time or someone wants to help me out. I was inspired to use
a more minimal option after looking at <a href=https://asahilina.net/>Asahi Lina's under construction page</a> for
a while now. It's really cool, but it has no content. That was the state of my
site for a while essentially. While I thought the theme I made was cool, I want
to actually post content. I think I will take a content-first approach and
backtrack on making the site nicer.</p><p>Feel free to reach out to me over Matrix if you are interested in helping me
with designing a better site for my blogs and content.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>Why I removed certain posts?</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>I had a bunch of stub pages for topics I originally wanted to expand upon. They
contained now actual content however and served as clutter on this page. For
now, I have marked them as draft status and they can be found on the GitHub page
for this repository. A lot of those pages were not related to kernel/OS
development or any of my non-technical interests. While I find those topics
interesting, I want to keep myself focused on a core set of topics for now.</p></div></div></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
