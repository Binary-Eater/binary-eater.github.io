development, we will get there (I promise). However, I think some background
context is in order. Rewind a year back to LPC 2022, I was attending LPC for the
very first time (virtually). I was super excited since LPC is basically a
treasure trove of talks that typically catch my interest. One downside though
was that I had to primarily follow the eBPF and Networking track since I was
sponsored by NVIDIA (and more specifically, my team) to attend. Networking is
interesting in general, but I tend to like topics in any subsystem that are more
focused on PC-class problems rather than datacenter-class. My job at NVIDIA is
heavily focused on networking (datacenter-class) in the Linux kernel (but more
on that in my <a href=https://binary-eater.github.io/about/>about</a> page).</p><p>As luck would have it, I did manage to sneak in watching a couple of
non-Networking related talks at LPC 2022. Two which really stood out to me were
<a href=https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1367/>"Extending EFI support in Linux to new architectures"</a> and <a href=https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1202/>"nouveau in the times
of nvidia firmware and open source kernel module"</a>. In the first talk, the
content helped break down the EFI boot flow based on the UEFI specification. It
then broke down different Linux boot patterns that mapped to the stages after
the EFI firmware <code>LoadImage()</code> / <code>StartImage()</code> calls. Honestly, I had no idea
what the process looked like between the stages of EFI firmware to
"bootloader/EFI stub" in the boot process till this talk. In the next talk,
there was some discussion about what NVIDIA could do for the nouveau community.
Jason Gunthorpe, the linux kernel RDMA maintainer (works on IOMMU as well in the
kernel) as well as VP and distinguished engineer at NVIDIA, proposed that it
might make sense for NVIDIA to provide option ROMs as the correct distribution
method for the firmware control bits needed to work with NVIDIA GPUs. (Fast
forward in time, we landed GSP in the linux-firmware tree though the blobs are
quite large and updating these blobs is problematic in terms of API
compatibility. This is a non-issue for NVIDIA internal drivers since the
firmware and driver have a more glued development process compared to typical
upstream kernel drivers.) Knowing Jason, I was sure his proposal was a good one.
However, I was just sitting there dumbfounded thinking to myself "what is an
option ROM?"</p><p>Yeah, I did not know what an option ROM was… As I post more articles, it will
become apparent that there are a lot of things that I do not know with regards
to low-level computer science concepts (which is a tragedy). An option ROM is a
firmware blob that is loaded on the main system ROM or the ROM of an expansion
device. This blob will take care of both device initialization as well as
extending additional functionality on top of the BIOS image. This means that an
option ROM can instantiate special services in the BIOS for things like graphics
or audio related operations that can then be made available to the booted OS.</p><p>LPC 2022 got me thinking that there is a lot I do not know about boot firmware
and how it sets up the boot stages on PC-class devices. I figured I could learn
through the process of porting <a href=https://doc.coreboot.org/index.html>coreboot</a> on a device. Having graduated for a
while and working out of my apartment during the COVID-19 pandemic, my personal
laptop was not seeing much use. However, it was a nice device that could be well
used rather than abused for a learning experiment. I decided to gift it to a
family member who would just share his wife's laptop at the time and struggled
doing anything personal. EFI is one of the most critical parts of a system and
if I did not have a good plan, I could end up with something that I could not
trivially recover and work with.</p><p>While searching around on this topic, I made a very interesting discovery. A
company called CMIzapper made a device called a <a href=https://www.cmizapper.com/products/mattcard.html>Matt card</a>, which is a pluggable
EFI ROM chip that takes advantage of LPC+SPI connectors on older MacBook devices
to bypass the EFI ROM on the logic board. I assume Apple had this connector for
support technicians to be able to work on devices with a bypass method in case a
MacBook owner set a firmware password on the device or something was wrong with
the EFI ROM. Truthfully, this seems like a pretty poor security model for a
device, and I assume this design passed for a while before more thought was put
into root of trust for PC-class devices. Keep in mind the Trusted Computing
Group published the first TPM2.0 standard in April 2014. While the connector may
seem bad from an end-user perspective, it seemed perfect for some EFI
development enthusiast. The LPC+SPI connector seems like the perfect interface
for coreboot testing.</p><p>I decided to take to eBay to find an old MacBook device that would be the
appropriate candidate. I ended up finding a MacBookPro8,3 that fit the bill.
However, there is no existing Matt card that has the same ROM chip as the
device. Honestly, this was fine since I rather make a custom PCB for this that
is open source, and I could add something for making it trivial to dump custom
payloads on the ROM chip. Keep in mind this is a back burner project in my low
priority bin, so…</p><p>Anyway for the longest time (a whole year), I have only needed my personal
desktop for the most part and have not used a laptop for personal use. Recently,
I started travelling more and would like trivial access to an environment that
enables me to follow up on discussions on kernel mailing lists, so I set up the
MacBookPro8,3 by purging the system and setting up NixOS on it with a LVM on
LUKS on LVM scheme with full disk encryption with encrypted <code>/boot</code>. Also, this
is a great way to motivate me to look into my DIY EFI test breakout board idea
(kernel-related activity always takes the highest priority for me).</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>WiFi woes with bcm4331</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>The device worked pretty well with NixOS out of the box, except for the WiFi
which was very problematic. NixOS is a really smart Linux distribution. In fact,
I consider NixOS to be less of a Linux distribution and more of a programmatic
ecosystem (that uses a functional programming-esque DSL) for stitching userspace
components of Linux and the kernel to get a booting system (almost like guided
Linux from Scratch). <code>nixos-generate-config</code> generates a dynamic configuration
based on a hardware scan of the device. Anything hardware specific is placed in
<code>/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix</code> and more generic options are passed to
<code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> if the file does not exist.</p><p>The <code>hardware-configuration.nix</code> file contained a specification for installing
an out-of-tree proprietary Broadcom driver for the wireless NIC. This
configuration would lead to WiFi connections that would constantly drop. From
simple kernel debugging (aka reading the kernel logs), the Broadcom proprietary
<code>wl</code> driver triggers this warning whenever the connection drops.</p><div class="src src-text"><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-text data-lang=text><span style=display:flex><span>[Jan 1 21:50] ------------[ cut here ]------------

which leads to the frequent disconnects. I did not bother to properly
investigate it (I could have though) since it's a proprietary driver that
Broadcom considers the devices supported to be "legacy".</p><p>The community had actually made an upstream reverse engineered driver that
supports bcm4331, the <a href=https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/b43>b43</a> driver. The main requirement for using this driver is
to use out-of-tree (due to licensing) extracted firmware blobs for the device.
NixOS makes it extremely trivial to acquisition these blobs compared to some
other distributions, making this a trivial process for me.</p><p>The experience was significantly improved compared to Broadcom's proprietary
<code>wl</code> driver. Was doing some Rust practice on my setup while away from home and
wanted to push my changes to GitHub. I use git over ssh, and ssh uses IP QoS by
default for prioritizing its traffic channels. I thought about breaking down the
ToS field in IPv4 headers to better explain this concept. However, the Wikipedia
for this is pretty good, so I will leave a link instead,
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_of_service#Allocation>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_of_service#Allocation</a>. Basically, network
applications can annotate the "priority" of traffic they send. A lot of
networking hardware try to prioritize video, voice, and background traffic
differently from normal traffic. This is to ensure that other network loads you
may run in the background do not disturb an important company or family
video/voice-chat. This also enables low priority traffic to be de-prioritized
compared to normal traffic. QoS is really important for offering the incredibly
seamless and wonderful network experience people take for granted today.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that when Tx traffic lands on any of the DMA-ed rings
for different QoS priorities other than the default best-effort ring in the
<code>b43</code> driver, the traffic fails to actually xmit with no indicator or error
completion events from the device for the driver to trace. I sent an initial
patch series to the linux-wireless mailing list with the expectation that I
would need feedback (I found bugs in the existing codebase with regards to an
existing mechanism for disabling QoS in the driver).</p><p><a href=https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20231230045105.91351-1-sergeantsagara@protonmail.com/>https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20231230045105.91351-1-sergeantsagara@protonmail.com/</a></p><p>I already knew that likely the very first patch in the series I was sending
would need to be dropped. I mainly wanted to better understand the intent of the
warning. We had some good discussions about the queue index selection for
<code>ieee80211</code> related function calls. What did surprise me though was the
expectation that the firmware I was testing with may be "too old." I had tested
with both a 2011-02-23 FW release and a 2012-08-15 FW release, which both lead
to the same behavior on a device that released in early 2011. These releases are
the only FW releases that are provided by the b43-dev community, so my patch to
drop QoS from being enabled on bcm4331 in the series was favored. However,
enabling QoS is important, but I am not entirely sold that a newer firmware
image extraction will make this "magically" work.</p><p>I am hoping my v2 will likely be merged, given the state of review.</p><p><a href=https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20231231102632.4e6f39eb@barney/>https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20231231102632.4e6f39eb@barney/</a></p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>Conclusion</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><p>While my patch series may fix the experience when disabling QoS on <code>b43</code> and
improve the out-of-box experience for bcm4331 users, disabling QoS by default
for the device is kind of lame. My first goal was to make the device fully
usable with the driver in a quick manner. Now, I think I need to look at FW
cutting new firmware blobs from newer Broadcom proprietary driver releases. I
expect the newly cut FW to not magically resolve this, so I assume the next step
