The BPF VM subsystem in the Linux kernel is immensely powerful. Covering it would require a separate article. For now, think of eBPF as some kind of mechanism that magically enables sandboxed loading of injected logic into priveleged contexts from userspace. bpftrace makes use of eBPF to inject dynamic tracing instruments.</description></item><item><title>kexec</title><link>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/kexec/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 21:32:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://binary-eater.github.io/posts/kexec/</guid><description>What is kexec? kexec is short for kernel execute. At a high level, it is analogous with the syscall exec. kexec replaces the memory of the currently loaded kernel image and begins executing the newly loaded kernel image. tl;dr it enables users to run new kernels without needing to do a full power cycle of a system.
What is the value of kexec? Enables a &amp;#34;boot once&amp;#34; flow for testing a potentially problematic kernel.</description></item></channel></rss>
